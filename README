this is a sass version of Matthew James Taylor's CSS-only column layouts. (http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/perfect-multi-column-liquid-layouts)
there is only one sass file for all layouts needed. (layout.scss)
all the example code is left in screen.css

open layout.scss and type in your preferred layout and column widths and you re ready to go!
f.e.:
$layout_mode: col3;  //col3,col3blog,
$col_right_width: 25%;
$col_center_width: 50%;
$col_left_width: 25%;

use lean.html if you want to start with your own website right away without any example html-content


limitations:
Currently only the 3 column & 3 column-blog layouts are implemented
